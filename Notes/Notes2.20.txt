#Homework:

Create a task class
write timings into the class, start and end times.
contains bursts of cpu and IO
CPU contains duration and time left
IO contains duration and device

task: (start with cpu, X amount of (io cpu) pairs then term)
	cpu
	io
	cpu
	io
	cpu
	term

different events:
	New Task
		cpu or IO, task creation params

	cpu done
		
	IO done

	Simulation done

wait queue
ready queue
